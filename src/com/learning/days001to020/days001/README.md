Hello world
--

#### Problem statement:
We have to print `Hello World!... Welcome to Java World....` text on the console with the help of Java. 

#### Solution:
```java
package com.learning.days001to020.days001;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!... Welcome to Java World....");
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:

- `package` is the reserve keyword to Java. In simple words "It is a directory" holding our classes.
- Bookish definition is "`package` in Java is a mechanism to **encapsulate** a group of **classes**, **sub packages** and **interfaces**. "
- `public` is an **access modifiers**, which defines the who can access this `class`.
- Different types of **access-modifiers** are `public`, `protected`, `private` and `default`
- `class` is also a reserve keyword for defining class's body.
- `println` is static method defined in the `System.out` class, with the help of this we can display any `string` messages on the console.
